## Project description: Procedurally generated planet

For the final project I would like to make an attempt at creating a procedurally generated planet. 
* Level of Detail techniques
* Types of sphere: UV, normalized, spherified cube, spherified pyramid, fibonacci, icosphere
* Terrain: Cube marching, or noise texture mapped to sphere
* Optionally extend to a little solar system
* Collision detection to allow for a player to land on the planet
* Lighting: A sun, could try to add an atmosphere

These ideas have been thoroughly explored by Youtube content creator Sebastian Lague, though he uses a full-fledged game engine, so I hope his videos can be trusted to be used as a resource and entry point for further exploration and not as copypasta.
